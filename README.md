# Text-summarization

Text Summarization Web App ðŸ“„âœ¨

This project is a Text Summarization Web Application built with Streamlit and SpaCy. It allows users to input or paste large blocks of text and instantly generate concise summaries using extractive summarization techniques. The application is designed to provide a simple, intuitive interface and fast performance, making it ideal for summarizing articles, reports, and other lengthy documents.
Features

    Interactive User Interface: Developed using Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
    NLP-Powered Summarization: Leverages SpaCy's natural language processing capabilities to extract the most important sentences from the input text.
    Custom Styling: Includes aesthetically pleasing, responsive UI elements like animated headers, gradient text boxes, and styled buttons.
    Real-Time Results: Instant summarization with output displayed alongside original text.
    Statistics Display: Provides word counts for the original text and the summary, along with a calculated compression ratio.
    Open Source: The code is modular, reusable, and open for contributions and improvements.

Technology Stack

    Streamlit: For building the web interface.
    SpaCy: For natural language processing and summarization logic.
    Python: Backend scripting and core logic.

How It Works

    Input Text: The user pastes or types the text they want to summarize.
    Preprocessing:
        Tokenization of the text.
        Removal of stopwords and punctuation.
        Word frequency analysis.
    Sentence Scoring: Each sentence is scored based on the cumulative frequency of its words.
    Summarization: The top-ranked sentences are extracted to form the summary.
    Output: The original text, summary, and text statistics are displayed in the app.
